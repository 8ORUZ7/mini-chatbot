## Documentation

After participating in an AI contest exam from Japan Internships, I became aware of advanced trends and techniques, such as using script isolation to hide API keys and prevent abuse. Inspired by this, I initially sought to build a Python-like compiler using only an HTML file (with embedded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and to bypass CORS restrictions for direct AI API calls.

Although I was unable to achieve a pure frontend solution due to CORS and security limitations, I pivoted to a backend deployment approach. This enables secure use of Google Scripts for AI-generated replies, keeping API keys protected and ensuring reliable AI integration.
